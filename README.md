# vanilla_nn
A simple neural network made using only numpy operations. 

PyTorch and Tensorflow are amazing have boosted ML productivity and testing immensely! But sometimes I fear that the comfort they provide may come at the expense of loosing touch with the basics. I wanted to train on a binasry classification problem without using any ML libraries to freshen up my core NN theory.
